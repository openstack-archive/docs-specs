Audio Visual training videos
==========================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-training-guides/+spec/training-guides-videos

To increase the impact of the training guides, videos will be added to the
training guides. These videos will try to cover major OpenStack deployments
and installation of OpenStack modules so that the trainees do not get stuck.
