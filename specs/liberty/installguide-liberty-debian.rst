OpenStack Liberty Installation Guide: Debian
============================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals/+spec/installguide-liberty

The OpenStack Installation Guide for Debian requires a number of changes
and updates before it can be published to the OpenStack documentation site.

Problem description
===================

The following steps need to be taken before the OpenStack Installation Guide
for Debian can be re-published:

* Conversion to RST
* Testing and revision of content


Proposed change
===============

Here is where you cover the change you propose to make in detail. How do you
propose to solve this problem?

If this is one part of a larger effort make it clear where this piece ends. In
other words, what's the scope of this effort?

Alternatives
------------

What other ways could we do this document? Why aren't we using those?
This doesn't have to be a full literature review, but it should
demonstrate that thought has been put into why the proposed solution
is an appropriate one.

Implementation
==============

Assignee(s)
-----------

Who is leading the writing of the code? Or is this a blueprint where you're
throwing it out there to see who picks it up?

If more than one person is working on the implementation, please designate the
primary author and contact.

Primary assignee:
  aadamov

Other contributors:
  karin-levenstein

Work Items
----------

Work items or tasks -- break the feature up into the things that need to be
done to implement it. Those parts might end up being done by different people,
but we're mostly trying to understand the timeline for implementation.


Dependencies
============

* Include specific references to specs and/or blueprints in glance, or in other
  projects, that this one either depends on or is related to.

* If this requires functionality of another project that is not currently used
  by docs: document that fact.

* Does this feature require any new library dependencies or code otherwise not
  included in OpenStack? Or does it depend on a specific version of library?


Testing
=======

Please discuss how the changed document will be tested.

References
==========

Please add any useful references here. You are not required to have any
reference. Moreover, this specification should still make sense when your
references are unavailable. Examples of what you could include are:

* Links to mailing list or IRC discussions

* Links to notes from a summit session

* Links to relevant research, if appropriate

* Related specifications as appropriate (e.g., if it's an EC2 thing, link the
  EC2 docs)

* Anything else you feel it is worthwhile to refer to
