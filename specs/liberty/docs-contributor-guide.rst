OpenStack Documentation Contributor Guide
=========================================

Problem description
===================

Based on the docs contributors experience and feedback, the information for
the documentation contributors located on wiki sometimes contains outdated
info and can be improved by restructuring and supplementation.

As we are treating our documentation as the code and willing others to do so,
we need to relocate all the conventions, how to instructions and any docs
contributor-related things to the place that fits as a single-entry, full,
and neatly organized guide that answers questions that arise in the docs
creation workflow.

The wiki is definitely not much convenient, it has narrowed functionality and
lacks a number of features that have become essential part of any internet user
nowadays, such as search, proper navigation, and some others.

Moving things around will noways influence its openness to the community or
make the conventions less flexible. This will only unify and simplify the
process.


Proposed change
===============

We propose to initiate the creation of the Documentation Contributors Guide
targeted at the contributors to the OpenStack documentation that will cover
the following issues:

* Markup conventions
* Terminology and writing syntax conventions
* Screenshots and topologies conventions
* Documentation structure
* Gerrit workflow (HowTo)


Implementation
