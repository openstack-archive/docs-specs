==============================================
Documentation Contributor Guide reorganization
==============================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals/+spec/contributor-guide-reorg

To facilitate contribution for documentation more and more,
we should keep contributor guide readable as possible.

Problem description
===================

Documentation Contributor Guide contains various useful contents
for the docs contributors. Since we have added contents gradually,
however, the guide has become scattered.

Proposed change
===============

1. Sort current contents by task group.
2. Clarify the tasks to contribute docs.
3. Reorganize and add the contents by tasks.

Alternatives
------------

Keep the current guide as is.
