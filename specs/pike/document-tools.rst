Document openstack-doc-tools and openstackdocstheme
===================================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-doc-tools/+spec/document-tools


Problem description
===================

Documentation for `openstack-doc-tools
<http://opendev.org/openstack/openstack-doc-tools/>`_ and
`openstackdocstheme
<http://opendev.org/openstack/openstackdocstheme/>`_ is currently
divided between various README files in the project repositories and the
`OpenStack Documentation Contributor Guide
<https://docs.openstack.org/contributor-guide/index.html>`_. In some cases
content is duplicated, outdated, or missing.


Proposed change
===============

Create Sphinx documentation projects within the ``openstack-doc-tools`` and
``openstackdocstheme`` repositories, update and complete the documentation for
both repositories, then publish the guides to `docs.openstack.org/developer/
<https://docs.openstack.org/developer>`_.

Add appropriate links to the new guides from the **OpenStack Documentation
Contributor Guide** and the repository README files.

The ``openstack-doc-tools`` repository already has a Sphinx
documentation project that is not currently published but that can be used as
the basis for the guide.

``openstackdocstheme`` also has a Sphinx documentation project that provides
sample content for theme testing which should be retained or incorporated into
the published guide.


Alternatives
------------

-  Consolidate the content into a new **OpenStack Documentation Tools Guide**
   in the ``openstack-manuals`` repository.
-  Consolidate the content into the existing **OpenStack Documentation
   Contributor Guide**.
-  Maintain the status quo (do nothing).
