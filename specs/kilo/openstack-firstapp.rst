========================================
Writing your First OpenStack Application
========================================


Problem description
===================

Currently, OpenStack is missing documentation similar to other Python
projects, that introduces a new user to the API. One well known "first
app" tutorial in the Python community is the Django web framework's
`tutorial <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/>`_.

Proposed change
===============

A guide will be written that will introduce the OpenStack API, while
also showcasing an already written non-trivial Python application that
utilizes as much of the OpenStack as possible.

Alternatives
------------

None

Implementation
==============

Tom Fifield has organized a sprint in Taipei, for one week, in order
to have authors write content.

Work Items
----------

* Write content during the sprint


Dependencies
============

None


Testing
=======

The guide is written in such a way that all examples can
be run by the reader, and steps have been taken to verify that
all content is valid.
