Move driver docs out of openstack-manuals
=========================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals/+spec/move-driver-docs


Shared goals for driver documentation include:

- consistent documentation, comparable for each driver.
- version-independent documentation for each driver, meaning the
  OpenStack version can change but the driver documentation can remain
  the same.
- maintainable documentation for each driver that won't change much
  over time and remains accurate.
- reviewable documentation for each driver.

Some benefits we see for this new approach are:

- more flexibility in changing detailed driver documentation on the
  appropriate website.
- makes maintenance of detailed driver doc easier for contributing
  driver writers since they can choose their source and publishing
  chain that fits with their current workflow.
- reduces maintenance for core OpenStack documentation team.

The driver documentation for Compute, Storage, Networking, and
Databases will change as described so that the OpenStack manuals
contains brief version independent information and a link to a vendor
page with full details.

Problem description
===================

Many OpenStack projects include drivers to support specific hardware
or software.

Examples are:

* Cinder: block storage drivers
* Neutron: network plug-ins
* Nova: hypervisors
* Trove: Different databases

Many of these drivers are hardware or software specific and can only
be documented by the third-party driver vendor. Some vendors have
great in-tree documentation and update it regularly, others have none
or only outdated documentation. Since most vendors have already on
their web page documentation about the drivers, this spec proposes to
move the documentation to the vendor web pages and simply link to them.

This will reduce work for both documentation team and vendor drivers.

Proposed change
===============

The documentation team will fully document the reference drivers as
specified below and just add short sections for other drivers.

Guidelines for drivers that will be documented fully in the OpenStack
documentation:

* The complete solution must be open source and use standard hardware
* The driver must be part of the respective OpenStack repository
* The driver is considered one of the reference drivers

For documentation of other drivers, the following guidelines apply:

* The Configuration Reference will contain a small section for each
  driver, see below for details
* Only drivers are covered that are contained in the official
  OpenStack project repository for drivers (for example in the main
  project repository or the official "third party" repository).

With this policy, the docs team will document in their guides the
following:

* For cinder: volume drivers: document LVM only (TBD later: Samba,
  glusterfs); backup drivers: document swift (TBD later: ceph)
* For glance: Document local storage, cinder, and swift as backends
* For neutron: document ML2 plug-in with the mechanisms drivers
  OpenVSwitch and LinuxBridge
* For nova: document KVM (mostly), send Xen open source call for help
* For sahara: apache hadoop
* For trove: document all supported Open Source database engines like
  MySQL.


Section format for external drivers
-----------------------------------


For each external driver, we want to document briefly the driver in a
way that is version independend and include the current configuration
options.

Each section should follow this format:

* A short paragraph explaining the driver.
* A link with detailed instructions to the vendor site
* A default paragraph like::

    Set the following in your cinder.conf, and use the following options
    to configure it.

    volume_driver=cinder.volume.drivers.smbfs.SmbfsDriver

* And finally the autogenerated configuration options

Driver vendors can send in patches for these or create bugs.

Alternatives
------------

* Keep status quo: Add all drivers to Configuration Reference.
* Remove drivers, do not link to them at all - or just link to a
  single wiki page

Work Items
----------

* Inform third party driver contacts about change (note that we
  have to make this spec known to them earlier to get input on it as well)
* Change all content to follow the minimal format
* Enhance content (based on suggestion by driver vendors)


Dependencies
============

None.
