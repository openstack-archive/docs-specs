=================================
Convert the Training XML into RST
=================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-training-guides/+spec/convert-the-xml-into-rst

Key parts of the existing training-guides books at docs.openstack.org will be
converted from XML to RST. The RST format will support the automated creation
of HMTL slides. The HTML slides will be published as part of gate to
docs.openstack.org/training-guides.

This blueprint will also cover what xml content that will remain and not be
converted into RST.


Problem description
===================

- Since the training team has difficulty with the re-use of XML content, they
agreed to convert to a simpler markup and refer to the docs for the majority
 of the content.
- We agreed to follow the upstream training lead, so we need to convert the
XML into RST slides


Proposed change
===============

The RST format will follow the RST formatted upstream training material.
