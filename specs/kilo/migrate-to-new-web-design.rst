Migration to New Web Design
===========================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals/+spec/redesign-docs-site

The documentation team has reviewed and vetted a new web design. Here are the
example pages:

* `Main page <http://openstack-homepage.bitballoon.com/docs>`_
* `Content view <http://openstack-homepage.bitballoon.com/docs/book>`_
* `Search results <http://openstack-homepage.bitballoon.com/docs/search>`_
* `Example language landing page <http://openstack-homepage.bitballoon.com/docs/ja>`_

This blueprint describes the steps required to implement this new web design.

Problem description
===================

In brief, we have design problems that are addressed with the new design. The
problem to solve is how to get many documents to use the new design.

A related relevant document is the
`Docs.OpenStack.org Redesign Project Brief
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GGKTKHDMc8A0jerdv-K3ql0udnxMr-j4DlhL2Cj6kcw/edit?usp=sharing>`_ which describes the many problems with the current design.

The problem to solve with this blueprint specifically is getting the design
into Sphinx/jinja templates for use with RST source, as well as getting RST
source files from certain DocBook source files.

This is a phased approach to try to get many but not all docs migrated in the
Kilo release time frame.

Proposed change
===============

In the Kilo time frame, migrate these books to the new design:
* End User Guide
* Admin User Guide

As time permits, continue to migrate these books to the new design:
* Cloud Administrator Guide
* High Availability Guide
* API Quick Start Guide
* Virtual Machine Image Guide

To limit the scope of the migration, these books will not be migrated:

* Install Guides
* Operations Guide
* Security Guide
* Architecture Design Guide

These deliverables will remain in DocBook and use the Maven plugin for builds
for the Kilo release.

Alternatives
------------

Rather than use RST/Sphinx for the new design, we could migrate to
markdown/Jekyll which is what the prototype design is already using. The
OpenStack ecosystem currently supports Python systems like Sphinx and
oslosphinx is available with a theme already.

We could get rid of DocBook completely for all books rather than the phased
approach. I don't think that we have the time to do that in a six-month
release, so I'm proposing a phased approach.

Implementation

Work Items
----------

Research:
January 2015
- Investigate how to publish PDF files within this new design.
- Investigate how to ensure translation toolchain is supported with this new
design.
- Investigate using index.rst collections across repos for new deliverable
assembly. This is not a required task for the migration, but will certainly
help with information architecture going forward towards "every page is page
one" rather than book-like deliverables. (jaegerandi)

Frameworks:
January: Create a taxonomy for suggested tags as part of the `Conventions wiki
page
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Documentation/Markup_conventions>`_
(klevenstein, loquacities)

January 15, 2015: Create jinja2 templates from Jekyll designs for:
 - landing page (fifieldt)
February 1, 2015: Create jinja2 templates from Jekyll designs for:
 - search page
February 20, 2015: Create Sphinx template from Jekyll design for:
 - content page

February: Replace static www jinja templates in openstack-manuals with
new design

Proof of concept with content:
February 15, 2015: Migrate DocBook to RST for these books in this priority
order:
End User Guide
Admin User Guide
February 28, 2015: Update our build infrastructure
so that sphinx is used for publishing these documents:
End User Guide
Admin User Guide

February 20, 2015: Test templates across browsers to ensure parity with design:
* Chrome on Ubuntu, Fedora, Mac, Windows
* Firefox on Ubuntu, Fedora, Mac, Windows

February 15, 2015: Update oslosphinx to have new openstack-docs theme:
Currently the theme name is "openstack." Reviewing the plan with Doug Hellman,
we can either keep the openstack theme and start one named "openstack-doc" or
update the openstack theme to be the new design. I prefer to name a new one
"openstack-doc" so that the current openstack theme which can indicate when a
project's doc is incubated remains.
Updated to add: looking at the information architecture of the header, it looks
like it's best to have an openstack docs theme that doesn't necessarily live in
oslosphinx. Oslosphinx is used for http://specs.openstack.org,
http://ci.openstack.org, http://governance.openstack.org for example, and
http://ci.openstack.org has modified the header so that it wouldn't match the
other sites. As a result, the plan is to keep the oslosphinx theme with
oslosphinx and create a theme in a separate repo named openstackdocsthemes for application to all
content published to http://docs.openstack.org.

March (after POC complete): Migrate DocBook to RST for these books in this
priority order:
Cloud Administrator Guide
Virtual Machine Image Guide
High Availability Guide
API Quick Start Guide

March: Once migrated, apply new oslosphinx template to these repos and
deliverables:
openstack-manuals:
* End User Guide
* Admin User Guide
* Cloud Administrator Guide
* Virtual Machine Image Guide
api-site:
* API Quick Start Guide
ha-guide:
* High Availability Guide

March: Remind projects to update their theme for /developer/ docs for:
 * nova
 * neutron
 * glance
 * keystone
 * ceilometer
 * cinder
 * heat
 * horizon
 * ironic
 * sahara
 * swift
 * trove

Dependencies
============

Foundation web developers hand-off of current design HTML and CSS files.
(Done)
Core olsosphinx reviewers helping with theme creation and reviews.

Testing
=======

We need to test the new HTML design on these browsers/operating systems as a
priority:
* Chrome on Ubuntu, Fedora, Mac, Windows
* Firefox on Ubuntu, Fedora, Mac, Windows

Need to test translation toolchain.

Need to test PDF output if it's possible to get.
