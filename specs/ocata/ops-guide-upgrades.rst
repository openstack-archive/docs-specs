Operations Guide: Reference project upgrade notes
=================================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals/+spec/ops-guide-upgrades

Problem description
===================

Service upgrade notes located in project repositories require greater
visibility for operators.

Proposed change
===============

Several project teams have produced upgrade notes in the developer
documentation that are beneficial to operators:

- `keystone <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/upgrading.html>`_
- `nova <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/upgrade.html>`_ ,
- `cinder <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/393395/>`, and
- `neutron <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/neutron/devref/upgrade.html>`_

Due to a short development cycle for Ocata, the interim solution is to
provide links to this information in the Operations Guide to improve
visibility for operators. Links to other service upgrade notes will be added as
they become available.

There is a growing need to provide a project-based upgrade guide. During Ocata development cycle,
this can be discussed further, and give the opportunity for other core project teams
to discuss and document upgrade strategies. Then potentially scope and plan a guide at the OpenStack
Project Technical Group meeting for the Pike release.
